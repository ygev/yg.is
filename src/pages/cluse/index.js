            paragraphBody="After several legal precedents, designers began to pay more attention to web accessibility. During my time with Yext, I had my share of designing websites for commercial enterprises. As an SEO contractor that used client branding for custom web pages, Yext was wary of getting sued for accessibility issues on their client's behalf. Every team was briefed on the importance of WCAG, especially on websites that are used daily by millions of users. Generally, designers unquestioningly followed brand guides. However, when the client’s brand failed to meet WCAG, we notified them of their failings and proposed changes. This happened often. <<The frequency of WCAG noncompliance signaled to me that accessibility is still not something enterprises keep in mind.>> But why?" />

Simply put: <<teams are not sure who is responsible for accessibility.>> Is it the copywriters who compose descriptive text? Is it the developers who put in place aria-labels and alt-tags? Although both roles are pivotal, the foundation of accessibility does not lie in writing or code." />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="So where does web accessibility start?"
            paragraphBody="The barrier to full accessibility is erected before the developer even fires up his IDE. It is solidified before the copywriter rests his fingers on the keyboard. The key to the pearly gates of accessibility is visual design. Visual designers are the first line of defense against poor contrast, insufficient differentiation between hover states and non-descriptive link text. <<The path to accessibility begins in the designer’s Sketch file.>>" />

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Designers' Biggest Blunder"
            paragraphBody="WCAG has a number of criteria geared towards designers. <<The criterium most designers are familiar with is color contrast.>> Because of this familiarity, it is the easiest one to incorporate into your workflow. WCAG use a ratio to determine the sufficiency of color contrast between two elements. For instance, white-on-white would have a ratio of 1:1, whereas black-on-white results in 21:1. The minimum ratio to pass WCAG is 4.5:1. Exceptions apply to what is defined as Large and Bold text. See <<Figure 4>> for a demo." />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="A Few Hex Values Away"
            paragraphBody="It is worthy to mention a curious aside about the nature of color contrast ratings. The difference between passing and not passing WCAG can be a few hex values away. To us, the passing color looks virtually the same as the failing color. To Target, the passing color would save them $6 million. This is demonstrated in <<Figure 5>>. The two shades look identical to us, but not to a lawyer." />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Contrast Checks and Workflow"
            paragraphBody="During my time on Yext’s consulting team, I’ve observed a well-defined accessibility workflow. All branded assets were rigorously tested for passing color contrast. The team used WebAIM’s online Contrast Checker. I've interviewed visual designers from other companies. I learned that the <<WebAIM Contrast Checker is the most common used tool in the industry>>. It is used by many notable designers, including Studio Rodrigo, the team behind Adobe Fonts. Although this method is the most common, it is the least efficient.

There was a clear leader in the field. <<A lot of people made small half-hearted plugins that just display a little notification.>> They give you a binary answer; you either pass WCAG or not. Stark, the leading plugin, did the same thing. Except it was wrapped up in a clean modal instead of a default Sketch notification." />

            paragraphBody="Based on my competitive analysis, Stark is the best Sketch accessibility plugin the internet had to offer.

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="More Mac OS than Sketch" paragraphBody="The code for Sketch's UI consists of many native macOS frameworks. I followed Sketch's example and created a macOS-style modal for a start. With high hopes, I tabulated the feature groups for future development. I borrowed the half-colored scrubber from Adobe, so that one could keep track of the original color. The crown on the initial design is a large preview that takes up a quarter of the modal. Upon speaking with users, as well as my degree project advisor, issues were noted. <<The premature tabulation ensures scope creep.>> The preview is not representative of most elements that are tested for color contrast. The modal lacked Cluse identifiers. The half-color scrubber was an unfamiliar pattern to most users tested and was too small to click on." />

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="More Sketch than Mac OS" paragraphBody="Cluse's next iteration was more Sketch than macOS. Instead of the dark-mode hex inputs, it mimicked the Sketch inputs. The Sketch-modal-style header was now adornished with Cluse's logo and some instructions. It also sported two previews, one for large text, and another for small text. <<However, the copywriting of the labels was unclear; the interface suffered from feature bloat and poor whitespace management.>> The next version aimed to trim down the fat." />

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Learning Curve" paragraphBody="Having no experience with making Sketch Plugins of this size, I took to Googling some tutorials. Surprisingly, there are very few resources on this sort of thing, especially when you're trying to make your own user interface. [[Matt Curtis' tutorial in Smashing Magazine>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/build-sketch-plugin-javascript-html-css-part-1/]] is the most helpful guide I've found.

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Bridging Sketch API and a Web UI" paragraphBody="Although my interface is minimal, its implementation is not as simple as it looks. The actions of my plugin are more than Sketch API can accomplish singlehandedly. Sketch API needs to be supplemented by CocoaScript and MochaJS. CocoaScript is Sketch's proprietary language bridging Sketch API and internal macOS frameworks. MochaJS is used to bridge internal macOS frameworks and JavaScript. This allows me to create the UI with HTML and CSS and write all the logic in JavaScript." />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Deprecated Role Model" paragraphBody="Like the design, my development journey took inspiration from WebAIM's Contrast Checker. Before I take on a role model, I try to find its vulnerabilities. <<After trying to break the Contrast Checker for a few minutes, I found a functionality-breaking bug.>> If one scrubs the slider either to the left-most or right-most side and returns it to the middle, all the color data disappears. The user remains with shades of gray. I downloaded the source files of the web page and looked at the algorithm used for calculating the contrast ratio, as well as changing the hex value. <<Based on the presence of a math( ) function, I concluded that we're dealing with some fine vintage code.>> " />
          <ImgRight img={Fig26} padding="yes" />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Eliminating WebAIM's Hue Data Loss" paragraphBody="The loss of color data ocurred because WebAIM's code converted the hex user input into RGB for contrast ratio calculation. When you scrubbed the slider to the minimum brightness value, the RGB value was (0, 0, 0). This means that the original hue of the hex code is not retained. <<On the other hand, I used an HSL color model, which saves the hue. In HSL, the slider controlled by the user alters the luminosity value and preserves the hue, eliminating WebAIM's hue data loss.>> Then I filed a bug report to WebAIM." />

After some experimentation, <<I chose to highlight what separates this contrast plugin from the rest: a slider.>> My final iterations included an interactive slider on top of the site. <<Upon scrubbing back and forth, the entire background of the site changes and reveals whether the combination passes WCAG or not.>> This was also the most time-effective option, as I reused the very code Cluse uses to analyze color contrast.

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Beyond Screen-Centric Exhibitions" paragraphBody="As Cluse is my degree capstone, it was to be exhibited in the senior show. This posed an interesting challenge. <<Cluse was a piece of software, unlike other exhibited projects rooted in graphic design.>> How do I exhibit software? I did not want to put a screen on a pedestal and call it a day, so I decided to think about the context in which Cluse would be used in. <<As a result, my exhibition aims to recreate a designer's workspace.>>  I had a large desk, a chair and a plant to accompany the monitor. Additionally, I painted the gallery wall Cluse-blue and plotted vinyl decals on it to mimic the Cluse's homepage." />

          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Guerilla Sticker Campaign" paragraphBody="To expand on my exhibition, I designed transparent stickers with the three WCAG conformance levels and had them printed on transparent sticker paper with white ink. Each pile of stickers on the table was accompanied by a cube showcasing an example of that kind of color contrast, as well as a corresponding Cluse modal poster above it. The stickers were disseminated to people as a form of a guerilla campaign against poor color contrast. The audience were encouraged to place the stickers in places around campus. For instance, examples of exemplary color contrast, would get the AAA sticker, whereas poor color contrast would receive the A sticker." />
          <Paragraph paragraphTitle="Exhibition Feedback and Future Endeavors" paragraphBody="Feedback from faculty and students has been overwhelmingly positive. The new chair of Graphic Design at MICA proposed that it should be part of the curriculum of a UX class taught in the fall. I have started working on a Figma port for the plugin, so that it can be used in the classroom, starting Fall 2020. Otherwise, I will work on bug fixes as they come in and maintain the project as long as I can. [[Check GitHub for the latest release.>https://www.github.com/ygev/cluse]]" />
