As an SEO contractor that used client branding for custom web pages, Yext was wary of getting sued for accessibility issues on their client's behalf. Every team was briefed on the importance of WCAG, especially on websites that are used daily by millions of users. Generally, designers unquestioningly followed brand guides. However, when the client’s brand failed to meet WCAG, we notified them of their failings and proposed changes.
